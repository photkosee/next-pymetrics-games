# Free Pymetrics Games Site
> A site hosting a series of online assessments designed to measure cognitive and emotional traits (inspired by Pymetrics Games)

## Background
I delved into Pymetrics Games during my internship application and found the experience to be both enjoyable and insightful. These online assessments, meticulously designed to measure cognitive and emotional traits, left me eager to explore further. Surprisingly, I couldn't find a readily available free platform to engage with these games, prompting me to embark on the exciting venture of developing my own.

Opting for Next.js as my development stack aligns seamlessly with my ongoing internship project, offering a dual opportunity to enhance my skills and create a meaningful solution.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
